# Context

If you are gainfully employed, you have probably been forced to accept object-oriented programming into your life. When working with a language like Swift or C++ which doesn't have garbage collection, you will end up with a strong reference cycle, which will result in a memory leak.

It's good to have some coping strategies for such events. Let's work through an example.

# The setup

> Based on a true story

We have a strong reference cycle between the `WebView` and `MessageHandler` classes. The `WebView` is the main object in this module, and there‚Äôs going to be a memory leak when it is released.

As if that‚Äôs not bad enough, `WebView` has multiple roles: it views webs but *also* provides `Config`s, and thus is an egregious violation of the single responsibility principle.

```swift
class WebView {
  private let messageHandler = MessageHandler()
  var config = Config()
  
  init() {
    // Shares mutable state, but not only that...
    // Creates a strong reference cycle
    messageHandler.webView = self
  }
}

class MessageHandler {
  var webView: WebView? // Strong reference
  
  func doStuff() {
    guard let config = webView?.config else {
      // Should never happen, is almost certainly untested
      return
    }
    
    // Do something with config
  }
}
```

# `weak` to the rescue?

One might be tempted to change the reference to the `WebView` to be weak. This would work around the memory leak problem, but it still means that:

* `doStuff()` needs to check `config` and do something unusual if it's nil
* There‚Äôs still a cycle of access between the two classes
* `WebView` is still providing `Config`s

# Store that shared mutable state

What I would do instead is move the `config` property to a new `ConfigStore` class, which both `WebView` and `MessageHandler` will share.

This is üíÄ **shared mutable state** üíÄ, but that's OK, because sharing mutable state is *exactly* what classes are for!

```swift
class ConfigStore {
  var config = Config()
}

class WebView {
  private let configStore: ConfigStore
  private let messageHandler: MessageHandler
  
  init() {
    configStore = ConfigStore()
    messageHandler = MessageHandler(configStore: configStore)
  }
}

class MessageHandler {
  private let configStore: ConfigStore
  
  init(configStore: ConfigStore) {
    self.configStore = configStore
  }
  
  func doStuff() {
    let config = configStore.config // Config cannot be nil
    // Do something with config
  }
}
```

# Conclusion

* Shared mutable state is isolated in the `Store` class
* `WebView` no longer has multiple roles (does not provide `Config`s)
* More stuff can be made `private`
* Things which previously ‚Äúshould never‚Äù be nil now *cannot* be nil
* No reference cycles at all, not even weak ones
